# Educational Scripting Project

This repository contains a collection of educational and proof-of-concept scripts related to various computer science and security topics.

## Scripts

Below is a brief description of each script:

1. **AVL.py**: An implementation of the AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) self-balancing binary search tree.
2. **Ddos_detector.py**: A simple script for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
3. **LeakyBucket.py**: An implementation of the Leaky Bucket algorithm for network traffic shaping.
4. **secure_key_pair.py**: A script to generate secure public-private key pairs.
5. **binary_tree.py**: An implementation of a basic binary search tree data structure.
6. **disk_log_monitor.sh**: A shell script for monitoring disk usage and logging it to a file.
7. **log_searching.py**: A script to search and filter log files for specific events or patterns.
8. **TokenBucket.py**: An implementation of the Token Bucket algorithm for network traffic shaping.
9. **Data_Structure_Practice.py**: A collection of data structure exercises and examples.
10. **disk_usage.log**: A log file for storing disk usage data.
11. **LRU.py**: An implementation of the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache eviction algorithm.

## Usage

To use any of the Python scripts, run the following command:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

For the shell script, run:
```bash
chmod +x disk_log_monitor.sh
./disk_log_monitor.sh
``` 

## Requirements
* Python 3.x for Python scripts
* A Unix-based operating system (e.g., Linux or macOS) for the shell script
